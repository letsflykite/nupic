In this example, a midi sequence is fed to a CLA a fixed number of times, after
which the CLA is asked to make a multi-step prediction $SONG_LENGTH steps
ahead. We investigate how the number of times the sequence is fed into the CLA
affects the sequence predicted.

To generate sequences:

0. Turn midi into csv using midicsv.
1. Generate CLA sequence data from midi csv using midi_parser.py
2. Generate set of predicted midi song sequences by running "python midi.py"
3. Turn midi sequence files into midi csv files.
4. Turn midi csv files into midi using csvmidi.
